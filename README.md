    - The concert-this command will find three concerts for the artist you specify by the closest dates.

3. node liri.js movie-this <insert movie name>
    - The movie-this command will find movie details based on a movie name you specify.
4. node liri.js do-what-it-says
    - The do-what-it-says command will randomly generate a command and search content for you.
